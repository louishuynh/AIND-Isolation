    "This notebook is a brief report that summarises three evaluation heuristics that were explored for the Isolation board game of the Udacity AIND course.\n",

    "For determining the heuristics, we play a few games and we can observe that the following available information may be of use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of moves available to each player\n",
    "- The position of each player, in particular the 'centrality' of the player as being close to the end of the edge of the board increases likelihood of being isolated\n",
    "- The number of blank spaces around each player. Even when isolated, being surrouned by blank spaces still potentially allows a continuous run of 7 moves in this instance of Isolation.\n",

    "The 4 Custom Score functions that we explore are:\n",
    "1. Number of opponent moves\n",
    "2. Linear combination of moves vs opponent.\n",

The most likely explanation is the low cost of evaluating the heuristic allows us to more deeply search the game tree. The concept of using centrality to determine the potential futures moves is interesting but comes at the cost which limits the number of times we can iteratively deepen our search. Another potential option would be to aggressively follow or run from opponent but again it appears that simply searching deeper into our tree is more effective."
